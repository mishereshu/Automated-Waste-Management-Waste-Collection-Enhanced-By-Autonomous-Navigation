# Automated-Waste-Management-Waste-Collection-Enhanced-By-Autonomous-Navigation
A Roving Line Following robot With level sensing garbage Can 

This project presents the implementation and integration of a sensor integrated autonomous line following robot for precise and efficient waste collection and management. Leveraging the amazing capabilities of different sensor technologies, inclusive of Infrared (IR) Sesnors for line detection and navigation, Ultrasonic Sensors for obstacle and level sensing, Color Sensor for targeted house to house waste collection. Additionally, usage of dual H-bridge L298N for navigation of dc motors allows their seamless movement and the integration of toggle switch-based reflector system within households enables residents to call for waste collection requests as and when required. Through this innovative strategy the project aims to optimize waste collection and revolutionize waste management in urban areas by reducing need for human intervention ensuring timely and efficient waste collection
